# xp11scenery

This program **attempts** to organize the X-Plane 11 (more likely do most of the grunt work) scenery_packs.ini.

X-Plane 11 is a Flight simulation program (some call it a game)

I think "attempt" to organize the config file is the best I can hope for.
X-Plane 11 requires you to manually organize it's scenery_packs.ini when
you want to add/improve features to/in it.
The folders listed within need to be ordered in a specific order, if not
the program will not function properly.
Unfortunately X-Plane 11 has NO folder name standards.
So for example if airports (and airports are just 1 of many catagories) 
are required to be ordered first, it would be nice if the word airport or 
some other constant like 001 was required to be somewhere in the 
folder name...it is NOT! A folder name can be anything 
'Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport' or 'ft laundry dale plain takeoff area' or 
'KFXE_AP' (KFXE is a valid airport ICAO code) or 'Field of Dreams'
...whatever that developer wanted to name it.
